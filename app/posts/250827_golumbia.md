I’ve played video games for almost my entire life. I’ve done so on my phone, iPad, computer, and PS4; with family, friends, and strangers online; based on sports, shooting, engineering, racing, and politics; on timescales from thirty seconds to thirty days.

These video games are among the few things that my brain considers true free time. At Stanford, I often feel like I never have free time because my life outside of class and homework is filled with side projects, social events, and adventures. These are exactly the things I enjoy most—I wouldn’t give them up, and I don’t particularly want to. But on the rare weekends I spend at home, I find myself needing half an hour of Trackmania or Cities: Skylines to calm down after a day of work. I might not be working towards anything world-changing, but they bring me comfort. 

The games I enjoy tend to fall into four categories.

<ol>
<li><u>Games that are easy to win and allow me to be creative.</u> In middle school, I played <i>Poly Bridge</i> on my phone during long car rides. The game is an engineer’s paradise—it involves designing bridges under budget to support increasingly heavy cars in increasingly unusual situations. Instead of continuing through the game as usual, I spent dozens of hours on level 1.9 making hundreds of designs for the simplest drawbridge in the game.</li>

<i> One of my nicer bridges. </i> </div>

<li><u>Games that allow exploration and discovery.</u> One of my favorite games of all time was Island Flyover, a minigame in <i>Wii Sports Resort</i> that required flying around the game’s island to discover every landmark and Easter egg. I never managed to find them all, which meant I never lost the thrill of finding a new location.</li>
<li><u>Competitive games with simple, constant rules.</u> The video games I spent the most time playing were <i>Star Wars: Battlefront II</i> and <i>Rocket League</i>. I’d turn on the PS4 after school and play a few matches, always with the same rules and always against anonymous opponents. It was nice to turn my brain off for a while, but I got the most enjoyment out of competition—I loved being at the top of the leaderboard and would get frustrated when I wasn’t.</li>
<li><u>Games that are just work.</u> This includes games like Roblox tycoons and Hypixel Skyblock—they require tedious, repetitive tasks just to see in-game numbers go up. I would spend hours on games to earn millions of virtual dollars that, in the end, didn’t make me feel anything other than that I’d wasted my time.</li>
</ol>

This last category of games is the subject of David Golumbia’s essay “Games Without Play.” Golumbia focuses on Derrida’s use of <i>jeu</i>, a word that can be translated into English as both “game” and “play.” Since Derrida never explicitly defines his use of the word, Golumbia defaults to the interpretation of French sociologist Roger Callois, who writes that <i>jeu</i> must be "(1) free, (2) separate, (3) uncertain, (4) unproductive, (5) regulated, and (6) fictive." Callois uses hide-and-seek as an example of a game that fits all of these descriptions in some way, as do most children’s games. Golumbia finds that many games today do not fit all six criteria, but they are nonetheless useful in separating play from work, which roughly satisfies the antonym of each criterion. 

What Golumbia and I each find most interesting are games that are more like work than play. Golumbia suggests two types of games that fit this description: first-person shooters like <i>Half-Life</i>, where gameplay consists almost entirely of repetitively killing monsters, and MMORPGs like <i>World of Warcraft</i>, where gameplay consists of pre-determined quests done to get rewards and level up. The games I played in this vein, particularly <i>Hypixel Skyblock</i>, are most similar to MMORPGs. In <i>Skyblock</i>, players are tasked with building their home islands and completing mining, farming, and combat tasks in progressively more difficult environments to improve their gear and make money. Players might find ways to be creative and “win,” but the primary objective of the game is to continue playing the game at higher difficulties.

Why anyone plays these games is a complicated question. Many Skyblock players will tell you that the game is one long grind to collect whatever resources or money you need for your newest self-imposed goal. It feels like hell. But you don’t stop. Because somewhere inside of you is a little push to keep going, to collect ender pearls for thirty hours until you can finally afford a new set of armor and show everyone around that you’ve gone one level past them, and you’re now going to collect magma cream and blaze rods for another fifty hours until you can get another set of armor and a new sword to fight monsters with yet more health and more power. Or maybe you do it to make your automated farmer minions two percent more efficient so you can spend as little time as possible actively playing the game.

Golumbia identifies this as Nietzsche’s <i>Machtgelust</i>, roughly translated as “lust for power.” He identifies that the main addictive quality of games like these is the experience of leveling up, which gives the player a “visceral pleasure” often accompanied by “flashes of light and sound and other indications of power.” Players grind through repetitive tasks for that sense of accomplishment, reaching higher and higher positions in the game’s hierarchy while reducing the tasks and monsters and players of their world to mere objects. They may not realize it, but they are driven by power.

I don’t fully agree with Golumbia’s interpretation. In particular, I think he puts too much under the <i>Machtgelust</i> umbrella. For example, the sensation of leveling up is meant to be enjoyed alone in many games, excluding it from the power over others that Nietzsche’s term is directed towards. I loved games like <i>Cities: Skylines</i> that could only be played entirely on their own. 

That’s not to say my eyes didn’t drift to leaderboards every time they came on the screen. 

## Peter Bennett, Geophysicist

In 2021, I <a href=”/projects/ieso”>won three gold medals</a> at the International Earth Science Olympiad. 

At the time, IESO was the most exciting moment of my life. It was the culmination of two years of studying and practice that had consumed my life. Much of that effort was focused on Science Bowl, the buzzer-based competition that had introduced me to Earth science and made science fun for the first time in my life. I spent hours before, during, and after dinner on Discord calls with strangers—most of whom were far older than I was—as we practiced on old packets. I spent weeks studying textbook chapters just to prepare lectures for our middle school Science Bowl team. I spent months writing <a href=”/projects/esods”>Problems of the Day</a>, little free-response questions that I posted to a big Discord server and guided people through solving. 

After the competition, I estimated that qualifying for IESO took about five hundred hours of work. My current estimate is at least a thousand. I underestimated all those years ago because I struggled to understand the amount of work I’d done—what I was actually doing, where I found the time, how I managed to improve, and why I enjoyed it so much. There are <i>very</i> few things that could make me put in a thousand hours of work, which is why I figured IESO must not be one of them. 

I studied Earth science because it was precisely the type of game I enjoyed.

Kind of. Remember my first criterion for enjoying a game? I need something easy. Science Bowl, on the other hand, was <i>hard</i>. In the matches I played on Discord, I usually waited the entire game to hear a couple Earth science questions, only to be outbuzzed on each by a horde of seniors who called everything “stock.” Studying helped, but barely; I started to recognize some answerlines and get maybe one question a game. My skills went from humiliating to merely embarrassing.

Fortunately, there was more to studying than losing.

I often get asked by aspiring USESO competitors what textbooks they should use to study. My response is something along the lines of “none of them.” After finishing half of an introductory Earth science textbook, I began exploring the subject on my own, my second criterion for enjoying a game. My method for studying typically involved jumping between websites and Wikipedia pages to figure out how something worked. That meant my knowledge was spiky and based on things that interested me personally—the Gaia hypothesis, tectonics on Europa, the carbonate-silicate cycle—but understanding those things required cementing Earth science fundamentals that I needed for competitions. Without self-imposed rules and routine, my studying was play in the Derridean sense, full of childlike wonder and discovery. Accordingly, it felt like curiosity-driven free time rather than work.

My third criterion was satisfied by simple, repetitive, enjoyable games like Science Bowl. Even when I wasn’t winning, practice never felt like work; it was a place where I could turn off the monkey steering my brain and fall into the environment. I wasn’t relaxed per se—Science Bowl has produced the most stressful situations I’ve ever been in—but I didn’t need to force myself to focus as I often do with work. It didn’t hurt that physical buzzers are fantastic dopamine machines. The enjoyment from a single correct answer at my first Science Bowl practice kept the competition on my mind like a crush I couldn’t wait to see.

Finally, there was <i>Machtgelust</i>, my lust for power. The dopamine hit from a buzzer isn’t just from the flashing light. For me, the little red light was a sign that I had beaten all of these people, that I knew something they didn’t, that I must be faster and smarter and better than them. In online matches, every buzz I squeezed in proved that these people weren’t that much better than me. Answering questions and writing problems in the Earth Science Olympiads Discord proved that I finally knew more than the beginners around me. I obsessed over my exams, poring over the anonymized results from Training Camp to figure out which scores were mine. I spent my time chasing anything that would feed my ego. When I finally qualified for IESO, I was insufferable.

I’m currently playing in a Science Bowl tournament called NSBA that’s based on the NBA—it has a combine, draft, home court advantage, conferences, and playoffs like any self-respecting sports league. I was nervous to play because I was afraid to see how my gameplay had degraded a year after graduating high school. My <a href=”https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mGf6ipX92yabtU7nmOcFmjZw4Kh9mEMBvMeSkN_kYic/edit?gid=1965459951#gid=1965459951”>combine score</a> was ranked 18th out of 87 and I was drafted 25th overall. Your natural response to that might be <i>Hey Peter, that’s pretty good, isn’t it?</i> But it stung. Here I was ranked behind people I had played against and coached and, hell, people I still thought of as kids. Becoming aware of my deficiencies didn’t mean I had fixed them.

I’m working on it, though.

In April 2024, my high school’s college decisions page listed my major as Earth systems. In September 2024, I told everyone I met during orientation that I’d be majoring in geophysics. In March 2025, my Stanford Science Bowl bio said I’d be studying physics and possibly public policy.

As of August 2025, I’m planning to get a bachelor’s in computational physics and a master’s in international policy.

I’ve had a complicated relationship with Earth science ever since I started studying it six years ago. I only began studying it because it was the subject our Science Bowl team needed, and I read an entire introductory textbook because I was bored over winter break. I kept doing it mostly because I felt like I had to. There was a path to get better, and I enjoyed that path, so I fell into the local minimum

I’ve never felt drawn to Earth science because I care about it. There’s no existential reason driving my studying. Many people in Earth science care deeply about climate or environmental issues; I’m not one of them. 

Instead, I care about Earth science because I’m drawn to it, if that makes any sense. For a while, the subject felt inexplicably fun in a way that many other subjects didn’t. I used to think that I liked it because I happened to be good at it and I enjoyed that feeling (again we return to <i>Machtgelust</i>). I’m now pretty sure the actual reason is that it’s <a href=”/projects/useso”>gearsy</a> and has little puzzles that are fun for my brain to break down. My love for the subject is thus driven by a superficial enjoyment that I don’t wholeheartedly endorse. Returning to the crush metaphor, I like the feeling of being with Earth science rather than fundamentally loving the subject itself.

That’s okay! God knows I need some fun in my life. But I don’t see myself continuing with Earth science as a career, and it’s become more of a hobby than anything. I established a long time ago that I care most about helping the people I love and seeing them be happy. If I can make a career out of that, and maybe use my Earth science knowledge along the way, that’s all I can ask for.

Thanks for reading.
