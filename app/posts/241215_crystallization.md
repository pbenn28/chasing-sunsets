## Crystallization

A good life is a crystal, not a cloud. 

A cloud isn’t clear-cut. A cloud has edges that change every minute. A cloud is dull and blends in with other clouds. A cloud is directed by the air around it, rather than finding its own direction. A cloud is fleeting. 

In contrast, a crystal is well-defined: it knows what it is and what it isn’t. A crystal is bright and colorful. A crystal has direction, potentially many directions. (And these many directions make it all the more beautiful.) A crystal is distinguishable from other crystals. A crystal is powerful. 

The people we admire seem to have their lives all figured out. They know who they are, they know what to do with their lives, and then they act on it. It seems that in order to reach this kind of life, we need to start defining ourselves. This essay attempts to lay out how that process might occur.

Now, people are much more complicated than crystals, and Inconsistency begins by exploring that complexity. In response, Attunement uses Zadie Smith’s idea of attunement, which I argue can identify and potentially resolve the complexity in our lives. In Systematic Attunement, I suggest that attunement can be done through two methodical processes: Jenny Odell’s idea of “doing nothing,” which involves intentionally observing our environment, and Freire’s model of education, which involves intentionally learning from other people. Finally, The Good Life discusses how we can use systematic attunement to build a good life.

## Inconsistency

Tara Westover is a complicated person. 

As a child, Tara is fully shaped by her parents. She’s devoutly religious. She’s deeply distrustful of government. Even when her grandparents try to bring her to school, she refuses, trusting that her family is right about it. All she knows is loyalty to her family and their values.

Tyler, her quiet older brother, isn’t so loyal. He reads and listens to music and educates himself, becoming so attached to the idea that he leaves the family to go to college. This is when the cracks in Tara’s values start to show. She likes Tyler, listening to music with him and bonding where their family can’t see. She instinctively resists his efforts to subjugate their parents, but she’s drawn to them nevertheless. 

Tara chooses Tyler over her family. Tyler helps her study for the ACT and, eventually, get into BYU, where the cracks in her loyalty become permanent rifts. Suddenly, she’s exposed to all sorts of new experiences and new people, all of which test her commitment to her faith and her parents’ values. Initially, she sticks to them. She refuses to go to the doctor or take government money. But being on her own makes her ever aware of how useful these things are and how much pain her values are causing her. Eventually, she gives in.

At BYU, Tara is split between two worlds. On one hand, she has a powerful identity she was raised with, based entirely on her family’s values and their devotion to God. On the other hand, she’s a woman in college who needs to survive in the world. Her life is full of tension: between her anti-government stance and her need for money; between her personal safety and her need to look perfect; between her love for her parents and her dislike of the family scrapyard. 
Tara’s identity–her many identities–are inconsistent.

## Attunement

In Some Notes on Attunement, Zadie Smith identifies the inconsistency Tara feels. She finds that we are often inconsistent with ourselves in different moments. In one moment, Joni Mitchell might sound grating and shrill; in another, it might be the most beautiful song in the world. Smith couldn’t make sense of the phenomenon; I’d like to.

Happiness is determined by how we live our lives–how we spend our time and the things we decide to do. It’s not always logical, but happiness is predictable: getting sick makes us unhappy, doing well on a final makes us happy, ruining a shirt makes us unhappy, getting boba makes us happy. Thus, our happiness must be some function of all the things we do in our lives. See this problem from Math 51:

<blockquote>
<p>Math 51 students have discovered a wellness function F(x, y, z), a function of the time spent doing fun activities (x), working on academics (y), and sleeping (z): </p>
<p> F(x, y, z) = 51x<sup>1/4</sup> y<sup>5/12</sup> z<sup>1/3</sup>. </p>
<p>Find the values of x, y, and z that maximize this function.</p>
</blockquote>

Fortunately, fun, academics, and sleep aren’t the only things in the world. Unfortunately, this makes our wellness function fiendishly complicated. Perhaps my happiness depends on the close friends I have, my last midterm grade squared, the cube root of honesty, and a million other factors that are impossible to know and more impossible to optimize. 

At any given moment, I might be optimizing for some factor. I might make a new friend to optimize the social component of my wellness. I might head to Green Library to finish a problem set and reduce my stress component. But every time I do so, I’m missing out on something else. That might be something I know, like not working on an essay for COLLEGE 101, or something I don’t know, like missing a meeting for a new club. This is the idea of opportunity cost–your time could be used doing something else, which could potentially better optimize your function of values.

In Smith’s piece, she discusses the idea of attunement. In her case, attunement is primarily in the arts, where appreciation is something intentional that may not come naturally. In a more general sense, I think attunement is the act of exploring our opportunity cost. By listening to Joni Mitchell–giving up the safety of listening to music she knew she liked–she found that there was a hidden Joni component that would make her happier, much happier. Smith explains that she wouldn’t even recognize the part of her that dislikes Joni so vehemently. That’s because the two of them understand different sets of values. 

My favorite word of advice is “maximize luck”: meet new people, go to new classes, try new foods, listen to new music. It might not go well, and you might attend an event that bores you or eat a meal that disgusts you. On the other hand, you might discover something new to love, a new piece of your value function that you didn’t know existed. Congratulations! You’ve found a new way to be happy.

I’ve found that attunement allows me to resolve tensions in my identity, or at least clarify what they are. I wasn’t sure how to vote on a new local sales tax, since I liked the city’s projects but didn’t want to spend more money; after trying both sides’ arguments, I realized I preferred to have a robust city government. I recently changed my hair to a middle part; it doesn’t always look good, but it gives me more freedom with my appearance that I didn’t realize I liked. After joining Model UN and going to Stanford’s political events, I’ve found that local politics doesn’t interest me but international affairs does, even if I’m still a STEM kid at heart. After attuning myself to different beliefs and expressions and interests, they’re now a part of who I am. There’s still tension–do I want to major in physics or public policy?–but the details of that tension have crystallized in my mind.

## Systematic Attunement

If we want to understand our identities better, we must find a way to attune systematically. It seems like there are two interconnected ways to do this, which are by connecting with the world and connecting with people.

### Attunement to the World

In How to Do Nothing, Jenny Odell describes how she attunes with the world by “doing nothing.” Odell’s ideas are hard to define concisely, but she attempts to do nothing by going out into the world–visiting the Oakland rose garden, watching her neighborhood birds, walking a labyrinth–and escaping from societal pressure. The essence of an activity involving “nothing” is that the activity is done for its own sake. Watching Netflix isn’t nothing because it’s done for entertainment or to relax. Biking to class isn’t nothing because the biker is concerned about not falling, going at the right speed, and being on time. Listening to a lecture isn’t nothing because it necessitates paying attention to gain knowledge.

What all of these non-nothing (“substantial”) activities have in common is that they are optimizing for something, whether that’s entertainment, class time, or knowledge. Odell’s idea of doing nothing allows her to altogether escape the pressure of her value function. She quotes author Rebecca Solnit, who explains of the labyrinth at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco, “The circuit was so absorbing I lost sight of the people nearby and hardly heard the sound of the traffic and the bells for six o’clock.” This is the benefit of nothingness: it actively prevents us from thinking about everything that distracts us in our normal living.

This is how Odell practices attunement. Substantial activities are distracting. They ask us to engage in something, to participate in the world instead of observing it. When we step back from that engagement, it allows us to observe the world around us–the flowers, the concrete steps, the couple in the corner giggling to each other. And it allows us to observe ourselves. In a meditative sense, we might observe what makes us comfortable and uncomfortable, stressed and relaxed. We might observe what makes us happy right now or today or in the last week. In that observation, we might discover something new within ourselves.

### Attunement to Others

Odell’s method focuses on observation, which is startlingly effective at discovering things we can see silently (ourselves & nature), but is entirely ineffective for discovering things about other people. To learn from others, we need to actively participate in an activity that allows the sharing of information. 

In Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Paulo Freire posits that this sharing of information can come from education if it follows the problem-posing model. Freire’s vision of education was heavily influenced by Marxist theory–he identifies that the usual banking model of education, where students are taught by a teacher with inherently high status, causes the “oppression” in the title and cannot exist. He imagines a model of education that frees people from said oppression in that the teacher no longer controls the classroom and students learn from each other’s experiences. In other words, he aims to allow students to become attuned to each other.

In Freire’s model, the primary method by which learning occurs is via dialogue, both with teachers and other students. Dialogue reduces the structure of the content students learn, expanding the breadth of the curriculum to the experiences of other students and teachers. The goal of dialogue is to make students human–when they participate in the conversation, they become active thinkers, rather than simply passive absorbers of information. This is how attunement occurs. In the banking model, students gain specific knowledge about the world; in the problem-posing model, they reflect on their experiences and learn about others’ lives and identities, expanding their own lives and identities along the way. In terms of their value function, students might use reflection to clarify their identity and values, allowing them to be happier, and might use others’ experiences as data points to find new values and preferences.

In Towards Universal Man, Rabindranath Tagore takes this form of education a step further. Tagore’s ideal model of education is similar to the problem-posing model in that it prioritizes learning outside of the simple transfer of information seen in the banking model. His philosophy also matches that of Odell’s theory of nothingness; he believes being in nature allows greater reflection, whereas being in a standard classroom isolates students from a holistic view of their lives. 

Tagore and Freire’s views of education are clearly idealistic. Not every classroom can be perfectly egalitarian. Education needs to have some information transfer to prepare students for society. Schools can’t all be built in the midst of nature. But these models represent the ideal kind of education that allows students to learn about themselves, which is a necessary component of education as a whole and is useful for students’ lives. Whether education should focus on this loftier education or a more concrete form, their ideal allows students to better attune and understand their identities.

## The Good Life

It seems impossible to imagine someone living a good life without understanding their identity. Identity is at least prerequisite to the two clear components of the good life that we’ve identified, which are happiness and meaning. In order to be happy, one needs to know what makes them happy: which people in their life, which hobbies to fill their free time, even which movies to watch or songs to listen to. In order to have meaning, one needs to know what gives them meaning: which subjects interest them, what makes them feel satisfied when a project is completed, what kind of value they care about. In a broader sense, in order to live a complete life, one needs to know what kind of life they live.

But having a strong sense of identity doesn’t necessarily make a life a good one.

Consider the thought experiment posed by Susan Wolf in Meaning in Life and Why It Matters. It’s easy to imagine someone unreasonably wealthy, or at least with a not-so-demanding job, who spends their life flitting around to keep themselves entertained. They travel to Europe and spend time at the beach. They go to music festivals and film festivals. They try new cuisines. They develop fashion. They have summer flings and brief relationships. In a sense, this is the carefree life many people dream about.

Unfortunately, Wolf finds that her construction is not living a good life, and I agree. They might be superficially happy all the time, but that happiness doesn’t go towards anything deeper. Their life has no purpose, and that purpose is a requisite for a good life. 

Now consider this person, asking Reddit whether they have “good reasons for wanting to attend grad school.”

<blockquote>
<p> 1. Consider a career change, preferably in a liberal arts-related field as a contrast to 
my current, highly technical software engineering role. </p>
<p> 2. I'm hoping being exposed to new ideas in a masters program might provide me 
better insight on that. </p>
<p> 3. If I target a general area of study that interests me, it can leave open a wider berth 
of career options that I can decide on when I get closer to the program's completion. (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/owqxgo/do_i_have_good_reasons_for_wanting_to_attend_grad/">Reddit</a>) </p>
</blockquote>

I claim that this person’s life is analogous to Wolf’s thought experiment. Having already spent some time in industry, this person might graduate in their late 20s. Surely they’ll be ready to jump into their interesting, fulfilling career, right? But that might be difficult for TheAbLord. They don’t know what they want to study, only “a general area… that interests me.” They expect to find career options later on rather than preparing for a specific career right now. They plan to use grad school to figure out more of their identity, hoping that someday they’ll be ready to apply it and life a good life.

Now, this person might better understand their identity and interests after grad school, and I’d be happy for them if they did! And they went on to spend their entire life in college, as did Benjamin Bolger, they’d know exactly what they enjoy doing. But this endless stream of classes and grades is again missing something: purpose. As in Wolf’s thought experiment, a good life requires something deeper than flitting around and figuring out one’s identity. It has to be applied eventually.

This, in my opinion, is why we care about attunement. Attunement allows us to live better lives after we do it. After Jenny Odell spent time “doing nothing,” she might discover that she enjoys spending time in nature, allowing her to enjoy her life more afterwards. After a student spends time in education, they might understand the world and know how to navigate it. That enjoyment, that navigation, is the benefit they get. 

Attunement alone doesn’t make a life better; one needs to act on the results of that attunement. 

If you’re reading this, you’ve likely already been through over a decade of education. That’s a decade of attunement, a decade of figuring out your life. You might not realize it, but your identity is crystalline: defined, powerful, and distinct from others. Now don’t forget to use it.
