Last year, I founded and directed the first-ever <a href="https://scibowl.stanford.edu/">Stanford Science Bowl</a>, a high school Science Bowl competition that was the third college-hosted invitational in the US. We hosted a fantastic invitational at Stanford and collaborated with friends at Johns Hopkins, UCLA, and various high schools to host "mirror" competitions with the same questions across the country. We're hoping to continue the competition this year and host even more in-person competitions, which has been my end goal for the Science Bowl community since my days working on <a href="/projects/prometheus">Prometheus</a>.
