I've been writing for Science Olympiad competitions since 2022. Initially, that involved tests for middle school competitions and for local invitationals that asked teams to supervise events. Last year, I wrote Geologic Mapping for Stanford and Golden Gate Science Olympiad before being recruited as an assistant event supervisor for Dynamic Planet at nationals.
