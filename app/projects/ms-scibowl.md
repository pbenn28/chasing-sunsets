I often tell people that my life started in eighth grade when I joined my middle school's Science Bowl team. That team was the first place where I felt a desire to be great, and it was the first time I had seriously devoted myself to something. When I reached high school, the thing I felt most attached to was helping that team survive and giving other people that same feeling.

I coached the team for all four years of high school, and I still occasionally return to lecture and help with practice. I spent over 500 hours with the team and gave something like 30 lectures at weekly practices. In my senior year, I took over as the team's head coach after our longtime teacher coach left. Working with middle schoolers is enormously frustrating at times, but it's also enormously rewarding.
