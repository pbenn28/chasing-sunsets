USESO selects the US team for the International Earth Science Olympiad and organizes other programs for high schoolers interested in Earth science. I'm one of the exam team leads for the organization, leading a team of other <a href="/projects/ieso">alumni</a> who are the backbone of the organization. Our <a href="https://www.useso.org/resources/past-exams/">exams</a> are often regarded as higher quality than any other high school olympiad because the energy is provided by recent alumni. I'm happy to contribute to that energy.

I've also been a counselor at USESO's Training Camp since 2022, where I give an annual lecture on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/B7P97C27rvHPz3s9B/gears-in-understanding">gearsyness</a> as an introduction to the camp.
