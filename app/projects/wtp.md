My senior year of high school was consumed by We the People, a national competition based on civics and the Constitution. I studied the structure and functioning of local, state, and national governments with Unit 4, one of the competition's six "units" that students are divided into. Our school placed third at nationals and we were the highest-ranked Unit 4 in the country.

In college, I've been a semi-regular guest judge at my high school and volunteer for <a href="https://californiansadvancingciviced.weebly.com/">CACE</a>, the organization that runs We the People in California.
