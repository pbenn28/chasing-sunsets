I'm currently Head of Marketing for <a href="https://www.stanfordias.org/">SIAS</a> and I help organize some of the club's many events. The club connects IR and policy majors with each other and with faculty through professor chats, coffee chats, and all sorts of internal social events. It also hosts the Stanford Model UN team, which I compete with and help <a href="/projects/smunc">staff</a>.
