I'm currently working as an undergrad researcher in the Gratta Lab at Stanford, an experimental group that focuses on fundamental particles and interactions. I'm one of three members of the xenon1g project, which is in the early stages of an experiment designed to discover a <a href="https://backreaction.blogspot.com/2021/07/whats-fifth-force.html">new fundamental force</a>.

At high temperatures and pressures, many materials undergo a transition into a "supercritical fluid," where the distinction between gas and liquid disappears. Near where this transition occurs, these materials tend to have a cluster-like structure with molecules weakly clumped together. When light passes through structures with length scales comparable to its wavelength, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering">scattering</a> occurs, similar to how light scatters off of droplets in a cloud and reflects in every direction. Our project aims to produce scattering using x-rays and neutrons passing through supercritical xenon. Our knowledge of physics predicts that the amount of scattering at a given angle of reflection should be the same for x-rays and neutrons. If a new force is present, we would expect it to act only on neutrons, so the two particles would produce different data.

I'm currently prototyping methods for stabilizing and characterizing the xenon we use. My early work involved creating a system for setting and maintaining the temperature of the xenon; our prototype currently achieves stability of ±0.01°C. Over the summer, I set up an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach%E2%80%93Zehnder_interferometer">interferometer</a> to measure the density of the xenon, characterize its phase transitions, and test methods for scattering measurements with visible light. My work is a mix of hardware, electronics, software, data analysis, and bashing my head against a wall.
