In 2022, I attended COSMOS at UCSD in Cluster 3: Climate Change. I worked on a research project investigating the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells made with natural and artificial dyes. Our first main finding was that dyes absorbing lower-wavelength (and thus higher-energy) light are initially more powerful but degrade quickly over time, while dyes that absorb higher-wavelength light last longer. Our second main finding was that dyes made from natural sources are just as powerful as artificial dyes.
