In 2022, I co-founded <a href="https://prometheus.science">Prometheus Science</a>, an organization that ran science competitions focused on <a href="https://prometheus.science/mission">existential risks</a> and humanity's future problems. In 2023, I took over as president of the organization. 

Our main project was Prometheus Science Bowl, which began in 2022 as the largest Science Bowl tournament ever run. In 2023, we expanded the tournament to a series of in-person and virtual tournaments, which easily beat our record from the previous year. We then hosted the first-ever independent national championship with a prize pool of $25,000.

We also hosted Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK), which had participants submit proposals for ensuring powerful AI systems stay aligned with human values.

Across the two years that Prometheus ran, we received over $200,000 in funding and engaged thousands of participants. We decided to wind down our efforts in 2024 after funding conditions made it harder for us to run. I'm okay with that, thoughâ€”two years was enough to have a lasting effect and I still get questions about Prometheus today.
