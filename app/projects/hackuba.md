I'm running a week-long hackathon in Guatemala with friends, acquaintances, and people I'd like to get to know better.

We'll be staying in a lovely house in the historic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigua_Guatemala">Antigua Guatemala</a> from December 13th-21st. The goal of the event is to work on a passion product in the spirit of <a href="https://www.socratica.info/">Socratica</a>—projects that take longer than an afternoon and people rarely have time for. That includes software, hardware, writing, art, and much more. We'll also be hiking and adventuring in the city.

This is a successor to <a href="https://hackuba.wordpress.com/">Hackuba</a>, a similar hackathon in the mountains of Japan that ran in 2023. I spent that week synthesizing bismuth, sulfur, alum, and salt crystals in the house's industrial kitchen.
