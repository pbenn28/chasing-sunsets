### July 2025 - SMUNC
My name is Peter and Iâ€™ll be your Chief Justice in this committee. Iâ€™m currently a sophomore at Stanford studying physics and public policy and Iâ€™m a member of our Model UN travel team. My background is primarily in STEMâ€”Iâ€™m an exam writer for the US Earth Science Organization and Iâ€™m currently doing fundamental physics research with the Gratta lab at Stanford. My interest in politics comes largely from a high school program called We the People, where I studied constitutional law and the underlying structure of government; more recently, Iâ€™ve been interested in energy, innovation, and housing policy. Outside of school, I love biking, climbing, Vietnamese coffee, surrealist fiction, collecting rocks, and making spreadsheets.

### May 2025 - USESO
hi! i'm peter. i'm a freshman at stanford studying physics, public policy, and apparently discord moderation, because i continue to run servers for the many things i'm interested in, including earth science, science bowl, science olympiad, and underwater basket making; but my friends will have you know that i enjoy many things outside of science, as you might have found me in the last week camping, biking, betting on the papal conclave, getting vietnamese coffee from coupa cafe, climbing at the gym with emmanuel, and writing sentences of length 90 words or more. excited to meet you all at camp :)

### October 2024 - Stanford Science Bowl
Peter is a freshman at Stanford planning to major in physics and international relations. He is formerly the director of Prometheus Science Bowl and the Earth Science Scrimmage and has written extensively for Science Bowl, Science Olympiad, and the US Earth Science Organization. In his free time, Peter enjoys collecting rocks, reading surrealist fiction, and making spreadsheets.

### May 2024 - USESO
hi everyone :) i'm peter and i'm a senior from foothill hs in pleasanton, ca going to stanford next year! was on the ieso team in 2021 and i've been volunteering as a writer + counselor for useso ever since. i do science bowl + science olympiad and staff/direct a lot of random tournaments; i've also dabbled in quiz bowl, model un, we the people, and various other olympiads. outside of all that i like fencing, biking, and playing spikeball (we WILL be playing at camp)! excited to meet you all <3

### November 2023 - AoC
hi queens! i'm peter, high school senior in pleasanton ca (bay area).
- stem: very into earth science, i'm one of the people running the us national olympiad. got into a lot of random competitions, particularly science bowl - i ran a thing called prometheus with what ended up being the biggest science bowl competition ever.
- non stem: i've been pretty into politics recently, currently reading the red and the blue by steve kornacki (about partisanship in congress basically). also been pretty into model un, chairing a conference in december with @devansh and @patrick <3! more broadly i realized recently that all my academic stuff has been weighing me down; been trying to focus on having fun with friends + vibing on my own and it's totally working :)

### June 2023 - Atlas
hi! i'm peter, i was at 2022 session 1 and i'm a rising hs senior in the bay area. i'm a little weird in the sea of math/cs/phys people because my interest for the last four years has been earth science - geology, oceanography, meteorology. i competed at the international earth science olympiad in 2021 and i've been working with the us olympiad ever since. have recently developed some takes on this along the lines of "we're not that important, just do something you enjoy" - would love to discuss that with anyone! still refining my thoughts here

my life currently circles around competitions, particularly science bowl and science olympiad. a big chunk of my life is spent running https://prometheus.science, a science bowl organization raising awareness about x-risk, with @patrick and @devansh. basically i'm trying to get more people into science + teach cool things to unsuspecting nerds.

please please dm me if you're in the bay area (living or visiting)! currently in tulsa for earth science stuff but i'll be back in a few days and want to meet up with everyone ðŸ¥º

### June 2023 - USESO
hey! i'm peter, i'll be a counselor at camp. got introduced to earth science by my amazing science bowl coach in 8th grade and have done it since. very much a competition guy - i do scibowl, scioly, quizbowl, model un, and assorted olympiads. have done a lot in the last few years but my main things are running https://prometheus.science and https://discord.gg/HVScP56Jmj !

### October 2022 - Prometheus
Peter is an experienced tournament organizer and a top science bowl competitor. In 2021, he earned three "Excellent" awards at the International Earth Science Olympiad, the highest distinction possible. Heâ€™s now an exam writer for the US Earth Science Olympiad and is working on bringing science to a wider audience with Prometheus and various other projects. Outside of science, Peter is an avid fencer and enjoys learning about and teaching rationality.

### October 2022 - AoC
hey! guess i never did this. iâ€™m peter, atlas session 1 and a member of the prestigious covid gang. currently a high school junior in pleasanton, california (near-ish berkeley).

iâ€™m generally interested in science, specifically earth science. i competed at the international earth science olympiad and won a few gold medals*, and iâ€™m currently helping out with the us team selection. i also do a lot of random competitions - science bowl, science olympiad, quiz bowl, all the things. planning to maybe study oceanography or astronomy in the future?

currently working on https://prometheus.science/ - a competition funded by ftx aiming to get people more invested in science and make smart high schoolers aware of x-risk. iâ€™m also interested in figuring out how to teach rationality, since i expect most people would want to learn it and just donâ€™t know how. would love to discuss this more! 

### July 2022 - LEES
hey! i'm peter (ieso '21) and i'm a rising junior at foothill hs in ca. i'm not a counselor for lees - i've got something else happening at the same time :( - but i was a counselor for training camp a couple weeks ago and i do other stuff with useso. i got into earth science through science bowl in middle school and science olympiad in high school, but i do all the things. there's a chance some of you know me from the earth science olympiads discord, and i'm generally very active on discord (which is why i'm here!). outside of earth sci i'm a fencer and i'd love to talk about thinking and/or how we're all gonna die.

### June 2022 - Atlas
Hey! I'm Peter, I'm 15, and I live in the Bay Area (~45 minutes away from Berkeley). I'm very interested in Earth science & astronomy, especially with climate change. Last year, I won a couple gold medals* at the International Earth Science Olympiad, which was basically my peak; I've since shifted to the organizational side of competitions. I'm not sure what my priorities will be after Atlas, but I'm hoping to continue working on Prometheus Science Bowl (https://prometheus.science), a huge competition focused on the future I co-organized recently. I'm also a fencer and I love reading, to no one's surprise. Excited to meet everyone!

### June 2021 - USESO
Hi! Iâ€™m Peter and Iâ€™m a freshman (rising sophomore?) at Foothill High School in Pleasanton, CA (not the one in SoCal). My favorite part of Earth science is probably oceanography, specifically circulation and currents, because most of it can be derived using simple physics and a metric ton of logic. I also compete in Science Bowl and Science Olympiad, although Iâ€™m not especially good at either. Outside of science, Iâ€™ve been fencing competitively for a few years, and in my free time I like to read or play Rocket League. Normally I wouldnâ€™t be excited to meet everyone (Iâ€™m a heavy introvert), but I am actually interested in meeting people who are like me.
