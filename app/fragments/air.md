Yes, sir, I have kept my inside on the inside. It has been difficult. I only learned how to do that recently; I figured it out after you told me to, when you decreed it was the only way to preserve my dignity. I have spent my last weeks packing my outside into a box that I stuffed in the back corner of my garage. No, sir, I don’t think they noticed. And if they did, they would respect me for it, right? No one worth talking to has an outside, right, sir? They’ve all heard your decree. I don’t think they noticed, because I left when I would have opened my inside. I made them forget all about it. And I went to get Filipino food and shoved those nineteen dollars into my inside because all I know how to do is turn myself into an overfilled stuffed animal. I’m scared, sir. I have too much inside. I can’t keep it all in.

<i>Just don't let them see.</i>

Yes, sir.
