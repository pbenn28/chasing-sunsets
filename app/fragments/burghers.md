Shadowed ghosts break the spell  
of wide green blades and comforting skies.  
Pedestals, broken with intent, sway  
beneath bare feet that might be  
cold in the winter but must be warm  
under the mist-filtered sun. Their robes  

are too thin; their bodies are too thin; they must have cut weight,  
or perhaps the sculptor did, shaving flakes of plaster towards  
perfection. My dark red cup, tea or whatever it was, would fill  
these phantoms, transform their inverted smiles. But it did not  
transform mine. Ice could have done it. Or a crispier sandwich.  
Delicacies that these Burghers will never know. Delicacies that rise  
in mission-style architecture from grasses that pour millions  
into the dirt. Delicacies for which our wealthy friends walk and walk  
and photograph and show their children: “this could be you.”  

But those children will not know the press of wet grass  
under their jeans. They will not see the roses  
that kiss my eyes, the distant squirrel  
under the frame of autumn trees;  
those children who suffer  
under the bronze.
