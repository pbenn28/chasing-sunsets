(read to the tune of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4HfLQJtVT1KiX1eVedDyTm?si=b69310f803094fbc">alaska by maggie rogers</a>. turns out <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3N4DI1vuTSX1tz7fa2NQZw?si=2c73218c6e9e48d7">rehab by amy winehouse</a> also fits that tune.)

i was walking / through icy streams that / took my breath away

they tried to make me / go to rehab / but i’ll be home with ray

a tiki bar right / under anna’s / lab in shriram’s maze

steps lead out to / the drinking hole where / equad takes its break

i sit in shade on / a man-made hilltop / judging postdocs’ gaits

headaches come and / go but this place / will always stay the same
