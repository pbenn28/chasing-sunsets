I was president and captain of my school's Science Olympiad team for two years. I won 33 medals across my time with the team, including 3 gold medals from our best-ever regionals placement in 2022. The team existed long before my time and will continue to exist long after, but I'm happy with how the team has grown in the last couple years.
