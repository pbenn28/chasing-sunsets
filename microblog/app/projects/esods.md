ESODS is the Earth Science Olympiads Discord Server, a ~2,000 member community of students from around the worl who are interested in Earth science. I've been a moderator in the server for the last four years.

My main work for the server comes from Problems of the Day, a series of multipart problems that I and a few other writers wrote over the last four years. You can see the full list of problems <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yv0bhTNt4_DVSyunZ59aj0qBoXKTaP-njMVja3oR5BE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
