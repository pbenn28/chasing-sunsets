I founded my school's Science Bowl club and captained the team for four years. We placed third in the Bay Area regional in 2023 and were <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B1DQBvSZG1TxzbyByhLFaBIssnJQ6BRLhukh7kHB59E/edit?usp=sharing">ranked</a> (dubiously) in the top 50 teams in the country. We also hosted the school's first-ever in-person competition as part of <a href="/projects/prometheus">Prometheus</a>. The club has grown to ~30 members and still practices and competes regularly.
