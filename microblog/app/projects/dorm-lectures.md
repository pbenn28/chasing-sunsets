I co-host Dorm Lectures, a casual student-run lecture series hosted every Sunday from 8-9 PM at Stanford. Each event has two students give brief lectures on topics they're experts in; recent lectures have covered topics such as Ferrari serial numbers, STEMinist fiction, civil disobedience, and LSD. Each event is located in a different dorm/house lounge hosted by one of our attendees.

If you're interested, consider <a href="https://forms.gle/4KyoZ41TkQ7CaD367">joining our mailing list</a>! Non-Stanford students are always welcome; just text me if you're in the area and need the location.
