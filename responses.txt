My name is Anna.

For work I write a lotta code and only a lil of it works.

You should listen to Incendie by Klô Pelgag.

If I could live anywhere for a month, it’d be splashing about in Kamakura, Japan—enjoying a wilted October in Edinburgh, Scotland—or running through the mossy fields of an Antarctic summertime.

I like my parents. That’s kind of a crazy question to ask, especially for those who don’t; but as all things are, it’s complicated, especially with those you love most.

The strongest emotion I’ve ever experienced is regret. Sometimes it drives me to lie and cheat my way out of confrontation; I’ll lie about why I’m late to work, or to a party, or to a lunch. Regret can spur my self-loathing like a crop rears a horse. But aside from the spikes of cortisol ravaging my blood vessels, regret can be nice: I like regretting time spent without others. It’s a form of loving and longing which I quite enjoy. And when I die someday, I hope there will be someone from whom I regret departing.

A red flag about my personality is that when I experience emotions, I can often swing between them like a mouse on a see-saw: bouncing back and forth, holding on with my little paws, trying not to fly into the sunset like the helpless little guy I am. Except I’m not a little guy, and I’m certainly not helpless. That is to say, sometimes my emotion is interjected by moments of self-reflection in which I feel spectator to my own life: that is to say, sometimes I’m not the mouse, but the weight that moves the see-saw. It’s hard for me to tell whether what I’m experiencing is real or manufactured. Is it manipulation if it’s unintentional? If the manner in which I behave is conditioned to avoid harshness—scolding—and embarrassment? Do I experience feelings of attachment so intensely because I am anxious of their departure—of their transience—or am I okay? I think I’m good at evaluating myself, but I think this is a symptom of overthinking—not underthinking.

I’m motivated mostly by feelings of nostalgia. I don’t particularly care what makes me “successful,” although this was terribly untrue for the bulk of my high school years; and I think it would still be untrue had I not pursued an education at Stanford. But now that I’m here, I’m less prone to comparing myself with others. I’m excited to tackle fun projects. My classes are overwhelming and exhausting, sure—and I become upset when lectured on them—but mostly because I don’t believe they’re a metric of my worth. I know I’m a good person—or that I try to be. And in the midst of what was probably the worst year of my life, senior year of high school, my mom came home from a visit to my teachers with a very proud statement: not about my grades, or from any of these instructors, but from a bus driver. I’d asked him whether he was okay after what looked like a confrontation with another student. And though it was trivial, and I really think anyone would’ve done it, it’s one of the only things I remember from a year of tears and hatred. I’m not sure how he bumped into my mom, or even how he knew my name, but she said it was one of the moments she’d been proudest of me. I don’t think I’d be the person I am today without my mom and my dad. When I was little, I pretended to be like characters in my favorite books, because they were nicer and less shy than me; I still do that sometimes, I think. A slightly more unserious conclusion but one that’s been fundamental to my development nonetheless.
